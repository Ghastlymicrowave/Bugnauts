  title: Green Peach Aphid - <i>Myzus persicae</i>
  body: '<line-indent=15%><line-height=110%>- Aphids are not native to the amethyst
    archipelago, but have become ingrained in its ecosystem as an invasive species.<br>-
    Aphids usually just stick to munching on leaves, but with enough numbers, they
    can cause tree destruction on a dangerously large scale.<br>- Aphids are a common
    pest insect that is eaten by Ladybird Beetles.  </line-height> '
  phantomBody: '<line-indent=15%><line-height=110%>- In their phantom forms, Peach
    Aphids have moved on from chewing leaves, and are now sucking the trees themselves
    dry!<br>- The Phantom Peach Aphids appear to be too small to hit with your bug
    net! Maybe freeing some phantom Ladybird Beetles would help!</line-height> '
